All about our daily lives

### License ?
Let's see if anyone can comply the rules with the license. I am sure no one will. I will just put the GPL something just to look professional. xD       

### What do we do here ?
This is the place where you nag about daily lives.       
This means we will only use the issues and pull requests. (probably, but maybe not)        

File an issue or PR that you think it should be changed in our daily lives.        
Probably we want this place as a life-changer for devs.       

Change the world!
